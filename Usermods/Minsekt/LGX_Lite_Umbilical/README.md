❗ATTENTION ❗

Currently only working in the combination with these two mods of me:

✖️MGN12H NATIVE EUCLID CARRIAGE

✖️SENSORISED HOTEND-CARRIAGE (LGX_LITE)

✖️LGX LITE EXTRUDER

Works best with this [Rear Umbilical Mod](https://github.com/Minsekt/MantisUsermods/tree/main/Usermods/Minsekt/LGX_Lite_Umbilical) of me.
